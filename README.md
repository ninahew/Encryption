## Project Description
I chose the option of building an encryption/decryption tool because this is something that I felt could have very practical applications in day to day life. 

## Rules
The tool has 2 modes, 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'. The user selects which they want to do, and is then invited to input their message.
In the case of encryption mode, a message in human language is entered, and an encrypted message is returned. 
Conversely, in decryption mode, an encrypted message is entered, and the corresponding message is returned in human language. 

## Workflow
Initially, I planned my project using a trello board. This allowed me to break the problem down into much more manageable pieces. Following that, I researched the game, and in particualr the process of Base64 encoding, which is the process used in this tool. Once I had a good understanding of that, I drew a flowchart to help me visualize the necssary steps, and then I began to code. 
This was the longest step, and once it was done I prepared the presentation of the final product. 

## Organization
In order to properly plan this project, I used a trello board. This helped me keep track of what needed to be done, and to order steps logically. 

My repository consists of 3 parts; a gitignore file, a README file, and my code.
